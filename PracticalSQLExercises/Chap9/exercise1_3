    --try it yourself--
In this exercise, you’ll turn the meat_poultry_egg_inspect table into useful information.
You need to answer two questions: how many of the plants in the table
process meat, and how many process poultry?
The answers to these two questions lie in the activities column. Unfortunately,
the column contains an assortment of text with inconsistent input. Here’s
an example of the kind of text you’ll find in the activities column:
    
    Poultry Processing, Poultry Slaughter
    Meat Processing, Poultry Processing
    Poultry Processing, Poultry Slaughter

The mishmash of text makes it impossible to perform a typical count that
would allow you to group processing plants by activity. However, you can
make some modifications to fix this data. Your tasks are as follows:

1.	Create two new columns called meat_processing and poultry_processing
in your table. Each can be of the type boolean.

2.	Using UPDATE, set meat_processing = TRUE on any row where the activities
column contains the text Meat Processing. Do the same update on the
poultry_processing column, but this time look for the text Poultry Processing
in activities.

3.	Use the data from the new, updated columns to count how many plants
perform each type of activity. For a bonus challenge, count how many
plants perform both activities.
