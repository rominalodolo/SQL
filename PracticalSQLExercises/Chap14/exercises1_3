    -- try it yourself --
Use the spatial data you’ve imported in this chapter to try additional analysis:


1.	Earlier, you found which U.S. county has the largest area. Now, aggregate
the county data to find the area of each state in square miles. (Use
the statefp10 column in the us_counties_2010_shp table.) How many states
are bigger than the Yukon-Koyukuk area?


2.	Using ST_Distance(), determine how many miles separate these two
farmers’ markets: the Oakleaf Greenmarket (9700 Argyle Forest Blvd,
Jacksonville, Florida) and Columbia Farmers Market (1701 West Ash
Street, Columbia, Missouri). You’ll need to first find the coordinates for
both in the farmers_markets table. (Hint: You can also write this query
using the Common Table Expression syntax you learned in Chapter 12.)


3.	More than 500 rows in the farmers_markets table are missing a value in the
county column, which is an example of dirty government data. Using the
us_counties_2010_shp table and the ST_Intersects() function, perform a
spatial join to find the missing county names based on the longitude and
latitude of each market. Because geog_point in farmers_markets is of the
geography type and its SRID is 4326, you’ll need to cast geom in the census
table to the geography type and change its SRID using ST_SetSRID().
