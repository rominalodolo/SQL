    --try it yourself-- 
Test your new skills with the following questions:
1.	In Listing 10-2, the correlation coefficient, or r value, of the variables
pct bachelors_higher and median_hh_income was about .68. Write
a query using the same data set to show the correlation between
pct_masters_higher and median_hh_income. Is the r value higher or
lower? What might explain the difference?
2.	In the FBI crime data, which cities with a population of 500,000 or more
have the highest rates of motor vehicle thefts (column motor vehicle_theft)?
Which have the highest violent crime rates (column violent_crime)?
3.	As a bonus challenge, revisit the libraries data in the table pls_fy2014
_pupld14a in Chapter 8. Rank library agencies based on the rate of visits
per 1,000 population (column popu_lsa), and limit the query to agencies
serving 250,000 people or more.
