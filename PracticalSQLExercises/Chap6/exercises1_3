Continue your exploration of joins with these exercises:
1.	The table us_counties_2010 contains 3,143 rows, and us_counties_2000
has 3,141. That reflects the ongoing adjustments to county-level geographies
that typically result from government decision making. Using appropriate
joins and the NULL value, identify which counties don’t exist in both
tables. For fun, search online to find out why they’re missing.


2.	Using either the median() or percentile_cont() functions in Chapter 5,
determine the median of the percent change in county population.


3.	Which county had the greatest percentage loss of population between
2000 and 2010? Do you have any idea why? (Hint: A major weather
event happened in 2005.)
