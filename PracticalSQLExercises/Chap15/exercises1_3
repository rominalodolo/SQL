    -- try it yourself --
Review the concepts in the chapter with these exercises:

1.	Create a view that displays the number of New York City taxi trips per
hour. Use the taxi data in Chapter 11 and the query in Listing 11-8 on
page 182.


2.	In Chapter 10, you learned how to calculate rates per thousand. Turn that
formula into a rates_per_thousand() function that takes three arguments to
calculate the result: observed_number, base_number, and decimal_places.


3.	In Chapter 9, you worked with the meat_poultry_egg_inspect table that
listed food processing facilities. Write a trigger that automatically adds
an inspection date each time you insert a new facility into the table. Use
the inspection_date column added in Listing 9-19 on page 146, and
set the date to be six months from the current date. You should be able
to describe the steps needed to implement a trigger and how the steps
relate to each other.
