Here are three exercises to test your SQL math skills:
1.	Write a SQL statement for calculating the area of a circle whose radius is
5 inches. (If you don’t remember the formula, it’s an easy web search.) Do
you need parentheses in your calculation? Why or why not?


2.	Using the 2010 Census county data, find out which New York state county
has the highest percentage of the population that identified as “American
Indian/Alaska Native Alone.” What can you learn about that county from
online research that explains the relatively large proportion of American
Indian population compared with other New York counties?


3.	Was the 2010 median county population higher in California or New York?
