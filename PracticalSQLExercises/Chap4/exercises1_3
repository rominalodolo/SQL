Continue your exploration of data import and export with these exercises.
Remember to consult the PostgreSQL documentation at https://www.post gresql
.org/docs/current/static/sql-copy.html for hints:

1.	Write a WITH statement to include with COPY to handle the import of an
imaginary text file whose first couple of rows look like this:
id:movie:actor
50:#Mission: Impossible#:Tom Cruise

COPY table_name
FROM '/Users/rominalodolo/Desktop/GitHub/SQL/PracticalSQLExercises/Chap4/exercise1.csv'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER, DELIMITER '|');

2.	Using the table us_counties_2010 you created and filled in this chapter,
export to a CSV file the 20 counties in the United States that have the most
housing units. Make sure you export only each county’s name, state, and
number of housing units. (Hint: Housing units are totaled for each county
in the column housing_unit_count_100_percent.)

COPY us_counties_2010 (geo_name, state_us_abbreviation, housing_unit_count_100_percent)
TO '/Users/rominalodolo/Desktop/GitHub/SQL/PracticalSQLExercises/Chap4/us_counties_latlon_export.csv'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER, DELIMITER '|');

3.	Imagine you’re importing a file that contains a column with these values:
17519.668
20084.461
18976.335
Will a column in your target table with data type numeric(3,8) work
for these values? Why or why not?
