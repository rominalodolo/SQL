    -- try it yourself --
Try these exercises to test your skills on dates and times.
1.	Using the New York City taxi data, calculate the length of each ride
using the pickup and drop-off timestamps. Sort the query results from the
longest ride to the shortest. Do you notice anything about the longest or
shortest trips that you might want to ask city officials about?
2.	Using the AT TIME ZONE keywords, write a query that displays the date
and time for London, Johannesburg, Moscow, and Melbourne the moment
January 1, 2100, arrives in New York City.
3.	As a bonus challenge, use the statistics functions in Chapter 10 to calculate
the correlation coefficient and r-squared values using trip time
and the total amount column in the New York City taxi data, which
represents the total amount charged to passengers. Do the same with
the trip_distance and total_amount columns. Limit the query to rides
that last three hours or less.
