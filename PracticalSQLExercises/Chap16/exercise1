    -- try it yourself --
    
To reinforce the techniques in this chapter, choose an example from an earlier
chapter and try working through it using only the command line. Chapter 14 is
a good choice because it gives you the opportunity to work with psql and the
shapefile loader shp2pgsql. But choose any example that you think you would
benefit from reviewing.
