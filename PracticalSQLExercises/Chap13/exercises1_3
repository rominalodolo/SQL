    -- try it yourself --
Use your new text-wrangling skills to tackle these tasks:


1.	The style guide of a publishing company youâ€™re writing for wants you to
avoid commas before suffixes in names. But there are several names like
Alvarez, Jr. and Williams, Sr. in your database. Which functions can you
use to remove the comma? Would a regular expression function help? How
would you capture just the suffixes to place them into a separate column?

2.	Using any one of the State of the Union addresses, count the number of
unique words that are five characters or more. (Hint: You can use regexp
_split_to_table() in a subquery to create a table of words to count.)
Bonus: Remove commas and periods at the end of each word.


3.	Rewrite the query in Listing 13-25 using the ts_rank_cd() function instead
of ts_rank(). According to the PostgreSQL documentation, ts_rank_cd()
computes cover density, which takes into account how close the lexeme
search terms are to each other. Does using the ts_rank_cd() function
significantly change the results?
