Here are two tasks to help you become more familiar with the concepts introduced
in the chapter:


1.	Revise the code in Listing 12-15 to dig deeper into the nuances of Waikiki’s
high temperatures. Limit the temps_collapsed table to the Waikiki maximum
daily temperature observations. Then use the WHEN clauses in the CASE statement
to reclassify the temperatures into seven groups that would result in
the following text output:
'90 or more'
'88-89'
'86-87'
'84-85'
'82-83'
'80-81'
'79 or less'
In which of those groups does Waikiki’s daily maximum temperature
fall most often?

2.	Revise the ice cream survey crosstab in Listing 12-11 to flip the table. In
other words, make flavor the rows and office the columns. Which elements
of the query do you need to change? Are the counts different?
