Understanding Data Types
        try it yourself

Continue exploring data types with these exercises:

1.	Your company delivers fruit and vegetables to local grocery stores, and
you need to track the mileage driven by each driver each day to a tenth
of a mile. Assuming no driver would ever travel more than 999 miles in a
day, what would be an appropriate data type for the mileage column in
your table? Why?

Mileage is a set value and will always be a 6 digit figure so using a real data type with floating type storage. This data type uses only 4bytes of storage and it'll be easier to determine the overall milage usage over time.  

2.	In the table listing each driver in your company, what are appropriate
data types for the driversâ€™ first and last names? Why is it a good idea to
separate first and last names into two columns rather than having one
larger name column?

varchar would be an appropriate datatype to use because you can specify the length of the name and the names can vary. 


3.	Assume you have a text column that includes strings formatted as dates.
One of the strings is written as '4//2017'. What will happen when you try
to convert that string to the timestamp data type?

It'll give you a syntax error because there is missing information for the date. But if you add the missing value ie: '4/7/2017' the program will return 2017-04-07 00:00:00
